# spaceFlightNews   



 ## Discription 
 -------------------------------------------------------
- This is a News app which display the latest space related news
- I used MVVM design pattern and  concepts of Clean architecture
- I have considered separation of concerns and the testability that each layer provides.
- I have implemeted an entity mapper for mapping the data between the network entity and the domain model which makes our network model replacable. 
- Dagger hilt for dependecy injection 
- I have Resource wrapper class for managing the request status and a responseHandler class for handling success and diffrent kind of IO exeptions  
- Since the idea of the project is to retrive and display latest news,I did not implement a local cash , but I have other projects in this 
 GitHub page in case needs to check my local cash implementation. 
- Junit 4  for unit test
